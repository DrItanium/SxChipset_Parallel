This project uses an ATmega1284p to act as a chipset for an i960SB-10 processor. The chipset runs in lockstep with the i960 and while slow does work wonderfully.
The project uses the MightyCore project from MCUDude. 

This project requires custom hardware that I have not released yet nor am I planning to do so in the near future.
